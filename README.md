## Platforms

This project uses Cargo and pure Rust stable and works on latest versions of Windows, Mac and Linux.

It depends on:
- [crossterm](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm)
- [ctrlc](https://crates.io/crates/ctrlc)
- [rustyline](https://crates.io/crates/rustyline)

## Install

You can either install it via `cargo` or download the binaries from github releases.

If you go the `cargo` route, you can install it using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/).
In a terminal, run this command to install `verco`:

```
cargo install verco
```

You'll be able to open `verco` from whichever directory you in.

## Usage

In a terminal in a repository folder, run the `verco` command.
It will launch `verco`'s tui and you'll be able to interface with git/hg.

Key Sequence | Action
--- | ---
ctrl+c, esc | cancel input/filter/select or quit
ctrl+j, ctrl+n, arrow down | move down one line
ctrl+k, ctrl+p, arrow up | move up one line
space | select entry when selecting
enter | accept selection
ctrl+f, / | enter filter mode when viewing action result
ctrl+w | clear filter
ctrl+h, backspace | pop one char from filter

## Custom Actions
You can create simple custom actions to run in your repository folder by placing them in the file
`.verco/custom_actions.txt` in your repository root.

Each line in this file is treated as a different custom action. Until the first whitespace, the characters are
treated as the keybind for the action, the next word is the command to be executed itself, and the rest are its parameters.

Example:
```
gv git --version
```

With `verco` open, you can type in `xgv` (`x` is the custom action prefix) and it will print your git version
without leaving `verco`. Use it to create build tasks for example.
